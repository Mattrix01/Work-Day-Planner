  - Renders that saved input when document refreshed

## Steps taken

- I linked up all my pages

- I wrote some pseudo code in javascript to make a plan

- I created my timeblocks in HTML

- I began styling them as well as adding some of my own styling

- I used moment to get the current date and time and displayed on page

- I used that moment data from API to style my timeblocks with the relevant colours using a for loop to iterate round the blocks.

- I set up local storage and click function on save button

- I trouble shooted some problems and focused on the first 2 block id's till i resolved issue

- I then finished up styling and matching up the rest of the timeblocks

- I began to add a clear all local storage button at the bottom as a bonus!
